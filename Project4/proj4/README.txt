USER: ZPARNOLD
PROJECT 4 OPTION B (MALLOC)

This program is attempting to mimic the behavior of malloc, calloc, and realloc as defined
by the header file malloc.h

(And some heavy research of the internet allowed me to discover some interesting things about
the behavior of these functions. Open source kernels are great...no?)

To run, simply point your directory to this folder, and type "make"
The program you'll want to execute is "./test"
